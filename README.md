No install automation yet. Here is just the list of what i use for future me, just to not to forget what my configs are about:
1. Neovim https://neovim.io/
2. RipGrep https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
3. Ranger https://github.com/ranger/ranger
4. Node.js, needed for coc extensions

# Windows tips
1. Install https://www.autohotkey.com/ and remap capslock to escape, works nice
